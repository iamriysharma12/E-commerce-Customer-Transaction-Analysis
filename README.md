# 📊 Ecommerce Analytics Dashboard

An end-to-end Power BI analytics solution built on 1,000 ecommerce transactions (Jan 2024 – Dec 2025), designed to answer real revenue, customer, returns, and marketing questions that a growing ecommerce business would ask its data team.

## 📌 Problem Statement

An ecommerce business generating ~$237K in revenue across multiple countries needed a single source of truth to understand:

- Which products and categories actually drive **profit**, not just revenue
- Whether growth is being fueled by **new customers or repeat buyers**
- How much **returns** are silently eating into profit, and where
- Which **marketing channels** deserve more (or less) budget, and how demand shifts seasonally

This project builds a 6-page interactive Power BI dashboard that answers each of these questions with drill-down detail, not just summary numbers.

## ❓ Business Questions Answered

1. **Which categories and products drive revenue vs. profit, and where does discounting cause losses?**
2. **Who are the highest-value customers, and how much revenue comes from repeat vs. one-time buyers?**
3. **What's driving returns, and which categories/shipping modes hurt profit once returns are factored in?**
4. **Which marketing channel acquires the most valuable orders, and how should Q4 seasonality shape inventory and spend?**

---

## 💡 Key Insights

- 📉 **Electronics drives 53.2% of revenue but only 30.8% of profit** — a clear revenue-profit mismatch worth flagging to category managers
- 🔻 **Discounts above 20% consistently push orders into a loss** — a hard ceiling for future promotions
- 🔁 **84% of customers (275 of 326) are repeat buyers, driving 95.2% of total revenue** — retention matters more than acquisition here
- 👗 **Fashion has the highest return rate at 14.16%**, more than double any other category
- 💸 **Returns cost the business 7.18% of total profit**
- 📈 **Organic Search is the top channel** by both revenue and profit
- 📅 **December is the peak sales month**; weekday sales run ~2x weekend sales
